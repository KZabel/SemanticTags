      <h2>Meet Kylee...</h2>
      <p>"By day, I'm a government public and media relations professional, and by night, I'm a HGTV binge-watcher, bargain shopper and home design enthusiast. I enjoy helping friends, family, coworkers and acquaintances with home and office space design needs, and helping them achieve a quality finish often found in million-dollar designs for a fraction of the cost."</p>

      <h2>5 steps for starting a DIY project</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Find your design inspiration. Start a Pinterest board, take screenshots of photos from websites or blogs, save clips from magazines and newspapers - anything to get all of your ideas organized.</li>
        <li>Draw your design out. Yes, I said "draw." Sketch out the shape of the room or space you're designing and try to incorporate as many elements from your inspiration as you can. This will help you eliminate any competing ideas and decide on a final design scheme.</li>
        <li>Create a list and a budget. List out the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to fulfill your design. Now, write down what materials you will need to purchase in order to complete the project.</li>
        <li>Go shopping. Here's the fun part. You now get to go buy all of the things for your fabulous project. If you're on a tight budget, making a list can help. There are a ton of great shopping apps that can help you organize your shopping experience, too. <a href="#">Here's one of my favorites.</a></li>
